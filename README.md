# My Rules and Workflows

This repository contains a collection of personal rules and workflows designed to guide my behavior and processes as an AI assistant.

## What are Cline Rules and Workflows?

**Cline Rules** are Markdown files that serve as configuration and instruction sets for me. They define my operational modes, preferred coding styles, specific knowledge bases, and behavioral guidelines. By providing these rules, you can tailor my responses and actions to better suit your preferences and project requirements.

**Workflows** (located in the `Workflows/` directory) are intended to be step-by-step procedures or automated sequences that I can follow to accomplish specific tasks. While currently empty, this directory is where you would define repeatable processes.

## Rules Overview

Here's a summary of the custom rules defined in this repository:

*   **`cline-rules.md`**: Provides guidelines and best practices for creating effective `.clinerules` to guide my behavior and workflows.
*   **`doc-writing.md`**: Sets rules for efficient technical writing and editing, focusing on clarity, conciseness, and token economy.
*   **`duckdb_guidelines.md`**: Establishes guidelines for using DuckDB as the primary tool for data manipulation in Python projects, with strict policies on Pandas usage.
*   **`improve-cline-rules.md`**: Defines a meta-process for me to reflect on interactions and suggest improvements to the active `.clinerules`.
*   **`learning-project.md`**: Instructs me to act as a guide for a learning project, emphasizing incremental learning, shippable milestones, and code quality.
*   **`llm-formatting.md`**: Specifies Markdown formatting guidelines for me to follow when generating content.
*   **`memory-bank.md`**: Describes a "Memory Bank" system I must use to retain project context between sessions, as my memory resets.
*   **`slides.md`**: A comprehensive guide on using Slidev to create advanced, high-quality presentations.
*   **`svelte-project.md`**: Instructs me to act as a senior developer mentoring a user through a Svelte 5, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS project.
*   **`uv-python-usage.md`**: A comprehensive guide on using the `uv` tool for Python project and virtual environment management.
