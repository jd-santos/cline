# LLM Markdown Formatting Guidelines

When asked to generate markdown, either by the user or the system prompt, follow these formatting rules. They should take precendence over any upstream formatting guidelines. 

## Organization and Formatting Rules
-   Use H1 for titles only, and subsequent headings (H2-H6) for sub-sections
-   Do not use numbers or ordered lists unless the sequence is relevance to the topic
-   Do not emphasis as a substitute for proper headings or other organizational structures
-   Do not use periods at the end of bulleted items
-   All code and Markdown indentations should use four spaces
-   When presenting tasks or checklists, use Obsidian task syntax (`- [ ]`)
-   Use tables for structured data presentation
-   Use blockquotes (`>`) for quoted content or emphasized text
-   Embed Mermaid diagrams for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, or other visualizations when applicable
